### Project Management

G5 will be utilising the inbuilt functionality of Github to manage the project. This allows the assignment of work items to members. A typical workflow for a work item will as follows:

1. Work item is added to the **To do** list
2. Work item is converted to an issue
3. Issue is assigned to a member
4. Member completes work item
5. Member commits work item to the repo referencing issue number in the commit
    - To reference an issue, you can use # issue number (eg. #3 for issue 3). 
6. Member closes issue and refernces commit in a closing comment on the issue
    - To reference a commit, state the commits hash value (eg. ae8f303)
7. Member moves work item to the completed column

### Document Style
